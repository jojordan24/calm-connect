Introduction: Thanks so much for agreeing to help us test the CalmConnect app today. We’re developing a wellness tool to better support students with mental health, including crisis resources, mood tracking, a chatbot therapist, and more.

Before we start, just a quick note: This is a test of the app, not a test of you. There are no right or wrong answers, and you won’t hurt our feelings, if something seems confusing or doesn't work the way you'd expect, that’s what we want to know. We're here to learn how students like you naturally use it. If it’s okay with you, I’ll read through a few questions first, then we’ll walk through the app. The whole thing should take about 10–15 minutes.

Verbal Consent Statement Before we begin, do you give your permission for us to observe and take notes during this session? Nothing will be recorded or used beyond internal improvement purposes.

Pre-Test Questions: Just to get a sense of your background:

Have you ever used any mental health or wellness apps before (like Calm, Headspace, BetterHelp, etc.)?
How often do you use campus mental health or wellness services?
Do you ever participate in online forums or communities for support?
Home Page Tour: Let’s start on the home screen. Take a minute to look around. What’s your first impression?

Facilitator Probing Questions:

What do you think this app is for, just from the homepage?
Is anything confusing or unclear?
Where would you tap if you were feeling overwhelmed and needed help quickly?
Task Scenarios: Here are a few short tasks to complete. Please think out loud as you go through them, speak whatever you're thinking, even if it feels obvious or silly. It'll help us understand your experience better.

Scenario 1: You’re feeling really overwhelmed and want to see what support is available. Task: Find resources for crisis help or support on and off-campus.

What made you click that?
Are the resources what you expected?
Would you know which one to contact first?
Scenario 2: You want to track how you’ve been feeling this week. Task: Use the mood tracker to log your current mood and write a quick memo.

How easy was it to describe your mood?
Would you feel comfortable using this daily?
Was anything missing that you’d want to include?
Scenario 3: You’re looking for a moment to calm down or breathe. Task: Find and start a guided meditation or relaxation exercise.

How would you decide which one to choose?
Does this feel personalized enough?
Would you use this in between classes or in the evening?
Scenario 4: You’re curious if other students are talking about stress. Task: Visit the community forum and see what’s being discussed.

Would you feel comfortable posting here?
What do you think about having moderators?
Do the topics seem relevant to you?
Scenario 5: You want ongoing recommendations based on your app usage. Task: Navigate to or describe where you’d expect to find personalized suggestions.

Does the app feel “smart” in learning your preferences?
Would personalized suggestions help you stay engaged?
Wrap Up & Post-Test Questions: Thanks so much, you did great. Just a few wrap-up questions:

What did you like most about the CalmConnect app, and if you could change one thing about it, what would it be?
What did you find confusing or frustrating, if anything?
How likely would you be to use this app regularly?
